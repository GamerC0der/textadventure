# Tutorial

To create your own site, press the make your own button at the bottom left of your screen.

## Customizing your design

Let's start with a name. Go to the theme settings node, then update "My Adventure" with the name of your game!

You can also enable spiders, these are the ones you saw on / and might be seeing right now, just on your own game. Optionally, you can also select an accent color for the buttons.

## Getting Started

Let's create a new scene by pressing the add scene button. Now update the text content for the start scene by tapping the content.

Now edit "Explore the Forest" to your own custom option text, then replace "forest" with "scene1" (or your scene's id).

Repeat this step to update the text and options for your first new scene!

## Playing your game

To play your game, press the play adventure button. Your game will open in a new tab. 

You can also share your game via an HTML file, by pressing Download HTML.

### Battles

Battles can also be added to your game to add your own RPG elements. Battles may only be added at the end as a final boss fight.
